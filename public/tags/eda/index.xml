&lt;p>To make it possible I used the following libraries:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pandas: To store the created dataframes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pandas.io.sql: To read the SQL queries into dataframes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Psycog2: To connect the notebook to the PostgreSQL engine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warnings: To make expections on warnings&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Business Questions:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is the total number of clients per country?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the total number of orders per country?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the average price per order per country?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the total invoice for each country?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the total profit for each country?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the 10 most ordered products?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the 10 most expensive products?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the 10 products with the highest invoice?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the 10 products with the highest unit profit?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the 10 most profitable products?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclussions about the Analysis&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once this EDA has been carried out, a series of conclusions are drawn:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The countries with the highest number of clients are USA, Germany, France and Brazil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The countries with the highest number of orders are USA, Germany, Brazil and France.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The countries with the highest average order income are Austria, Ireland, Denmark and Germany.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The countries with the highest total income are USA, Germany, Austria and Brazil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The countries with the highest total profit are USA, Germany, Austria and Brazil.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>According to the information extracted about the different countries and markets, it can be corroborated that the most developed and stable markets are USA, Germany and Brazil.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The most expensive product doubles the price of the previous product on the list.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most expensive product, despite its high price, generates the higher income.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surprisingly, the most expensive product is also the one with the highest profit, both on a unit and overall basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
