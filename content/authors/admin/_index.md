In my previous work experience, I have demonstrated a strong analytical ability and good skills on how to handle pressure, which has allowed me to work efficiently in a team.

In addition, I have advanced knowledge of Microsoft tools such as Excel and Access, and I have begun self-learning programming languages such as SQL and Python.

As a plus, I have a native level of Spanish and a B2 level of English (currently preparing the C1 Certificate), which allows me to communicate effectively in both languages.
